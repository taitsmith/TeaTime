# TeaTime
A tea guide project
Choose tea by region or type, then display a list of teas matching the criteria.
Users can select a tea from the list to see more information, including a description and instructions
for proper brewing temperatures and times. 

Mainly created as a personal project to learn about RecyclerViews etc.

//TODO possibly add a timer, create section to allow tasting notes, checkbox for 'tried it', etc.
