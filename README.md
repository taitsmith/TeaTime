# TeaTime
A tea guide project (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.taitsmith.teatime)

Choose tea by region or type, then display a list of teas matching the criteria.
Users can select a tea from the list to see more information, including a description and instructions for proper brewing temperatures and times.

Hasn't been updated in forever, probably contains bugs as I go through and figure out what I was in the process of doing.
