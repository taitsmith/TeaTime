# TeaTime
A tea guide project (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.taitsmith.teatime)

Choose tea by region or type, then display a list of teas matching the criteria.
Users can select a tea from the list to see more information, including a description and instructions for proper brewing temperatures and times. 

Update a year later: Cleaned everything and made it look nice. Got rid of that awful if/else if in TeaListFragment and replaced it with a switch. Added Butterknife, renamed a bunch of stuff.

Version 2 in progress: Switch to Realm (done), allow users to favorite certain teas and add short notes. Display similar recommendations when teas are selected.
