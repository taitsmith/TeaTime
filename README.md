# TeaTime
A tea guide project
Choose tea by region or type, then display a list of teas matching the criteria.
Users can select a tea from the list to see more information, including a description and instructions
for proper brewing temperatures and times. 

Update a year later: Cleaned everything and made it look nice. Got rid of that awful if/else if in TeaListFragment and replaced it with a switch. Added Butterknife, renamed a bunch of stuff. Next step will be adding Realm to hold all of the teas and allow users to make their own tasting notes.
