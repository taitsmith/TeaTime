    <!-- Tea descriptions -->
    <string name="gpg_desc">Chinese green tea from the Zhejiang province in eastern China.
        Its English name comes from the fact that the tightly rolled pellets resemble gunpowder.
        The rolling of the leaves helps prevent physical damage and breaking, as well as
        maintaining much of the flavour that would otherwise be lost.\n\nWhen purchasing
        gunpowder green tea, a shinier leaf is often representative of a fresher tea. Smaller
        pellet size is also a sign of higher-quality tea.</string>
    <string name="dw_desc">Also known as Lung Ching or Longjing. A green tea from the
        Zhejiang province in eastern China. Leaves are pan-roasted shortly after picking to
        produce a smooth, floral flavour with a slightly toast aftertaste. In the most strictly
        authentic definition, true dragonwell tea comes only from the one area in the Hangzhou region
        of the Zhejiang province. A majority of dragonwell tea comes from other regions of the province,
        with a smaller amount being prepared with the same technique using leaves grown in other
        areas. An experienced drinker may be able to spot the difference, although it is not
        immediately noticeable in many cases. \n\nWhen purchasing Longjing tea, be sure to look for
        a region or area of origin if it is claimed to be authentic.</string>
    <string name="assam_desc">A traditional black tea from the Assam region of India, known as the
        world\'s largest tea growing region. Assam teas are produced from a specific variety of the
        tea plant, known as Camelia sinensis var assamica (a plant native to this region). This
        variety is represented by a malty flavour and strong bright colour. Most tea blends labeled
        as \'breakfast\' will contain Assam tea, and Irish breakfast is generally made of CTC
        (finely shredded) Assam leaves. Compared to other Indian tea-growing regions, plantations
        here are located closer to sea level, with other regions generally being located in the
        highlands. The geography here, combined with the large amount of rainfall and high temperatures
        contribute to Assam\'s characteristic malty flavour.\n\n\ It is worth noting some fun facts
        about the Assam plant and region- Tea plantations in the region are in a separate time zone
        from the rest of Indian Standard Time. Known as Tea Garden Time, it is one hour ahead of the
        IST. The region is also one of two in the world with a native tea plant, the other being
        southern China. The Assam plant was first introduced to the west by a Scotsman, Robert Bruce
        in the 1820s.</string>
    <string name="bdp_desc">A fragrant tea from the Yunnan province in southern China. Hand-rolled
        tippy black tea leaves produce a malty flavour with some hints of chocolate. Dragon pearls
        are generally rolled with very high quality leaves and buds to produce a full bodied cup.
        These leaves are capable of producing multiple steeps while maintaining much of the original
        flavour.</string>
    <string name="ceylon_desc">Ceylon teas vary depending on the altitude at which plants are grown.
        Plants grown at the lowest elevation are bolder, mid elevation are less bold but with a more
        rich flavour. Teas grown at the highest elevation are generally smooth with floral notes.
        The high-grown teas are considered to be the finest the area produces, though any authentic
        Ceylon tea is seen as high quality. These teas will carry the \'lion logo\', a highly
        practice which is highly regulated by the Sri Lanka Tea Board. Any tea with this logo has
        been thoroughly inspected to guarantee quality.
        \n\nThe three distinct regions of tea production are the Upcountry (Udarata), Mid country
        (Medarata) and Low country (Pahatha rata). </string>
    <string name="eg_desc">Traditionally a Chinese black tea flavoured with
        bergamot oil to produce a citrusy taste similar to many expensive Chinese teas. The origin
        of the blend varies based on different sources, though it is commonly accepted that it is
        named after Charles Grey, a Prime Minister of England in the 1830s. One story claims that
        Lord Grey once saved a Mandarin man from drowning. The man was so grateful he presented the
        tea as a gift.\n\nEarl Grey is the drink of choice for Captain Picard of the Federation
        starship Enterprise.</string>
    <string name="eb_desc">Traditionally a blend of Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan teas. The combination
        produces a strong, rich full-bodied drink often mixed with milk and sugar.\n\n A fun fact on
        English breakfast- the blend and name is considered to have originated not in England, but in
        colonial America around 1843.</string>
    <string name="gen_desc">Often colloquially referred to as \'popcorn tea\'. A Japanese green tea
        combined with toasted rice. During the roasting process, pieces of rice can pop, and end up
        resembling popcorn. The rice lends smooth flavour with a nutty aftertaste. The blend was
        originally drunk by Japanese peasants, the toasted rice acting as a filler to allow expensive
        tea to last longer. While most green teas are steeped in cooler water for a shorter period
        of time, genmaicha is best prepared with hot water. </string>
    <string name="dar_desc">The Darjeeling region is one of two major tea producing areas in India
        (the other being Assam). Unlike the Assam region which has it\'s own native plant,
        the Darjeeling region uses the traditional Chinese variant of the tea plant. Darjeeling teas
        generally produce a floral, fruity cup. These are often referred to as the \'champagne of
        tea\'. There are several distinct types of Darjeeling teas, each with their own characteristics:
        \n\nFirst Flush: harvested mid-March following spring rains. Produces a very light cup with a
        mild aroma. Often fruity, peachy with a honey aftertaste.
        \n\nSecond Flush: harvested from the same plants in June, produces a darker, more full-bodied
        cup. Citrusy, crisp with an apricot aftertaste.
        \n\nAutumnal Flush: harvested at the end of the rainy season in autumn. Full bodied, fruity
        aftertaste.
        \n\nWhile most Darjeeling teas were traditionally black, it is becoming more common to see
        whites and oolongs produced as well.</string>
    <string name="gyo_desc">Traditionally shade-grown Japanese tea, one of the highest grades the
        country produces. Though categorised as a type of sencha, the plants that produce gyokuro
        are protected from the sun for two to three weeks prior to the harvest. Those that produce
        sencha are left uncovered. The shade serves to increase the caffeine content of the leaf,
        also creating a sweeter flavour and fresher aroma when compared to traditional sencha. Gyokuro
        is also steeped differently than most other green teas- at about 60 degrees celsius for 90
        seconds. A larger amount of leaves are generally used as well.
        \n\nAbout 40% of gyokuro produced in Japan comes from the city of Yame.</string>
    <string name="hoj_desc">Unlike other Japanese green teas, hojicha is a roasted version of sencha.
        Traditionally the roasting was done in porcelain pots over charcoal, but much modern hojicha
        is roasted in electric drums similar to the coffee roasting process. This roasting alters the
        colour from green to a reddish-brown and gives a toasty, caramel-like flavour. The firing
        also reduces the caffeine content of the tea, making it a popular after dinner drink.
    </string>
    <string name="ib_desc">Irish breakfast is most commonly made of finely shredded Assam teas.
        It produces a very strong cup of dark red to brown colour. Milk and sugar are typically
        added though it can be consumed plain. </string>
    <string name="keemun_desc">Famous black tea from the Anhui province Eastern China. Produces a
        smooth, semi-sweet cup with hints of smokiness. It was first produced around 1875 and very
        quickly became popular in the west, where it can still be found combined with Assam and
        other black teas in blends like English breakfast. It is grown in a mountainous area at
        lower temperatures with a high humidity, contributing to its characteristic taste.
    \n\nThe most common type of Keemun is the Mao Feng variety. Harvested earlier in the year, it
        produces a sweeter, lighter tea than other varieties.
    \n\nThe Hao Ya variety, harvested later, lends itself to a much stronger tea.</string>
    <string name="ctc_desc">Finely shredded version of classic Kenyan tea. Similar to Irish breakfast,
        produces a strong, dark cup typically consumed with milk and sugar. CTC Kenyan teas are
        often used in blends with tea from India or China.</string>
    <string name="kenyan_desc">Tea was first cultivated in Kenya around 1904 using plants from India.
        Teas grown here typically produce a rich, dark red cup. Farms in Kenya are set at a
        high altitude where the climate is much less arid than closer to sea level. A large majority
        of tea produced here ends up in black tea blends or processed in the crush, tear, curl method
        (similar to Assam in Irish breakfast). Kenya is the fourth-largest worldwide producer of tea,
        90% of which is grown on small farming operations as opposed to large plantations.</string>
    <string name="yun_desc">Sometimes referred to as Dianhong, a typically high-end black tea from
        southern China. Yunnan teas from other Chinese black teas, as they often contain many more
        \'golden tips\' and fine buds. Most Yunnan teas will produce a dark orange cup with sweet
        aroma and slightly malty taste. The area produces several varieties dating back to the early
        19th century:
    \n\nYunnan Pure Gold: considered to be the finest tea grown in the region. Typically contains only
        golden tips, and when brewed creates a bright red cup with a sweet taste.
    \n\nYunnan Gold: contains fewer buds than its Pure Gold cousin. Brews to a brassy red colour,
        slightly less sweet than Pure Gold.
    \n\nBroken Yunnan: low-end Yunnan tea, most often bitter on its own and added to blends. Brews a
        dark red-brown cup and contains few to no golden tips.</string>
    <string name="kuk_desc">Highly popular Japanese green tea. Produced largely from the stems and
        stalks of the tea plants used to create sencha, it has a naturally low caffeine content when
        compared to other green teas. Produces a very fresh vegetable taste, slightly nutty and
        creamy. Brews to a light green colour somewhere between sencha and gyokuro. Unlike most other
        teas, kukicha is commonly steeped three or four times while maintaining most of its flavour.</string>
    <string name="plc_desc">Pi Luo Chun is renowned for it\'s delicate and unique appearance. Curled
        leaves resemble snail meat (the name literally translates to "green snail spring") and produce
        a very strong aroma. The taste is somewhat fruity and floral. The smell can be off-putting at
        first, and it\'s original name \'scary fragrance\' reflects this. Legend says the Kangxi Emperor
        visited a village where the tea was produced and gave it the more appealing name by which it
        is now known. Today, true Pi Luo Chun is cultivated in the Jiangsu province in eastern
        China, though it can also be found in the Zhejian and Sichuan provinces. These teas are generally
        a lower quality and contain larger leaves and produce a nuttier flavour.</string>
    <string name="sencha_desc">Sencha is the most popular tea in Japan, usually representing about
        80% of the country\'s tea production. The season for picking sencha leaves is typically from
        early April to late May, with tea from the first flush being considered the most sought-after.
        Production of sencha differs from Chinese green teas in that they are steamed for a short time
        after picking, while Chinese teas are typically pan-fired first. Following the steaming, leaves
        are rolled, shaped and dried which lends them a characteristic flat cylindrical shape. Steaming
        has an impact on the final flavour of the tea, as well as the look- sencha tends to have a
        slightly more bitter taste than its Chinese relatives, as well a grassy, fresh vegetable taste.
        Water temperature can have a slight effect on the final taste, but the colour will generally
        be a greenish gold.</string>
    <string name="ls_desc">Lapsang Souchong differs from other Chinese teas in that it is dried over
        a (traditionally) pinewood fire. The drying and smoking leads to a a very distinct smoky
        flavour with hints of whisky. According to some legends, lapsang souchong claims to be the
        very first black tea, created when Chinese armies interrupted the annual drying of the tea leaves.
        After the interruption, tea producers dried leaves over fires of local pine to speed the process.
        The tea originated in the Wuyi Mountains of the Fujian province, though lapsang from this area
        is becoming increasingly expensive as demand grows. Lapsang is also produced in Formosa (Taiwan).
        Formosan lapsang generally produces a much stronger flavour and aroma. Tarry souchong, considered
        to be the most extreme of the varieties, is smoked over pine tar.</string>
    <string name="mpg_desc">Often referred to as \'golden monkey tea\', a black tea that originated
        in the Fujian and Yunnan provinces. It typically consists of a single leaf and bud (hand-picked
        and processed in spring), which resemble a monkey claw. The leaves are characterised by a pale gold colour,
        producing a light cup with honey, peach notes and a lack of astringency. It is considered
        one of the finest black teas available, and was a drink of choice among the upper class of
        ancient China. It\'s rarity came with legends that it provided agility and sexual prowess. It
        is typically grown at an altitude of 1200 metres.</string>
    <string name="sn_desc">Commonly called Baihao Yinzhen, the most sought-after variety of white teas.
        Only the top buds of the tea plant are used, with the best coming from first flushes in
        late March or early April. Leaves are picked in the late morning, after the sun has dried
        any leftover moisture. As white teas are lightly oxidised when compared to green or black
        teas, true silver needle leaves are laid in baskets to dry in the sun for an extended time, though
        many these days are done indoors. Silver needle tea produces a pale yellow cup with a sweet,
        delicate fresh vegetable taste. </string>
    <string name="jax_desc">A Korean green tea whose name translates to \'sparrow tongue\', a reflection
        of the leaf\'s tendency to resemble one. The grading of jaksul leaves typically depends on
        when in the season it is picked, as well as the size of the leaf. There are four main categories
        of jaksul:
    \n\nUjeon: picked before the first rainfall of spring. Generally considered the most special grade,
        it consists of only the buds of the tea plan.
    \n\nSe-jak: picked right after the first rainfall through spring, consisting of two leaves and the
        bud taken from the tip of each branch.
    \n\nJoong-jak: picked at the end of spring, this tea typically contains more mature leaves and
        no buds.
    \n\nDae-jak: picked throughout summer, usually machine harvested. These contain full-grown leaves
        and occasional bits of branches.</string>
    <string name="wp_desc">The literal translation of its Chinese name Bai Mudan, a Chinese white
        tea from the Fujian province. Generally viewed
        as having a stronger, fuller flavour than silver needle tea, the other main Chinese white tea.
        Picked tea is allowed to wither in the sun, which may last anywhere from one to three days
        depending on weather conditions. White peony produces a mild peony, floral aroma during the
        brewing process. The resulting cup is a pale golden green colour with a fruity, grassy flavour
        that is stronger than silver needle.</string>
    <string name="sm_desc">A Chinese white tea typically produced in the Fujian or Guangxi provinces.
        The tea consists of naturally withered upper leaves and tips that produce a a stronger cup
        when compared to other Chinese whites. The leaves are picked later in the season which lends
        a darker colour. It is considered to be of lower quality than other Chinese whites. When
        brewed, the resulting cup is fruity and slightly sweet with a strong taste.</string>
    <string name="dhp_desc">Literally \'big red robe\', a highly prized Chinese oolong from the Wuyi
        mountains in the Fujian province. It is heavily oxidised, leading to a dark colour. Legends
        say that when the mother of a Ming dynasty emperor was cured of illness by the tea, the emperor in
        return sent several red robes to cover the plants that grew the tea. Several of these bushes
        (reportedly dating back to around 960 CE) still exist today, and produce tea that can cost
        upwards of one million USD per kilogram. Cuttings taken from these mother plants produce tea
        of similar quality, with differences coming from the climate, soil and location in which it is
        grown. Increased global demand has lead to the need for increased production. Authentic da hong
        tea is generally served only to honour guests.</string>
    <string name="sh_desc">Literally \'water sprite\', it is the darkest of the Mount Wuyi oolongs
        from eastern China. The heavily oxidised tea brews to a dark brown with a sweet, honey-like
        fragrance. Shui hsien (also sometimes shuixian) is grown elsewhere in China and even parts
        of Taiwan, but these varieties are easily distinguished by their smoky, almost burnt taste.
        Some plants producing shui hsien tea can be over 200 years old.</string>
    <string name="sjg_desc">Literally \'golden marine turtle\', it is the lightest of the Wuyi oolong
        teas. Less oxidisation leads to a lighter, greener leaf as well as a greener, fresher tasting
        cup. Flavours include roasted nuts with a slight floral aftertaste.</string>
    <string name="tie_desc">Literally \'iron warrior monk\', one of the four most famous Wuyi oolong
        teas. On the lighter side of Wuyi teas, legends claim that it was created by a powerful
        warrior monk (hence the name), and is characterised by an intense green colour. Brewing to a
        lighter green cup, flavours are full-bodied and slightly floral.</string>
    <string name="tgy_desc">Literally \'iron goddess of mercy\', an oolong from the Fujian province
        of eastern China. It is named after the Chinese goddess of mercy, Guanyin. Legend says that a
        scholar, Wang, discovered the tea beneath the Guanyin rock in Xiping. The emperor was so
        impressed by the tea, he gave it the name Guanyin. There is a complex method of processing
        for Tieguanyin teas that can be simplified down to eight steps- plucking, sun withering, cooling,
        tossing, withering (this time with oxidising), fixation, rolling and drying. Different varieties
        of Tieguanyin are determined largely by the time at which they are harvested or the extent to
        which they are baked. Leaves harvested at the start of summer are generally regarded as the
        highest quality. Most tieguanyin teas are \'thoroughly baked\', with some producers now
        creating lightly baked teas. These lightly baked teas are considered closer to green tea
        than oolong.</string>
    <string name="pou_desc">A lightly oxidised oolong that is close to green tea. Pouchong originated
        in the Fujian province in eastern China, and has been produced in Taiwan since the late 1800s.
        The leaves tend to resemble curled rope with a dark green colour, and produce a floral cup
        with a rich, sweet flavour. Pouchong leaves are picked and produced around the end of March.</string>
